I know this isn't formal notation but it's good enough





FILE = KEYVALUES and/or OBJECTS

OBJECTS = OBJECT OBJECTS | OBJECT

OBJECT = "string = {" CONTENTS "}"

CONTENTS = LIST | OBJECTS CONTENTS | KEYVALUES CONTENTS

LIST = list of strings

KEYVALUES = KEYVALUE KEYVALUES | KEYVALUE

KEYVALUE = string " = " string
